# Exploratory-Data-Analysis(EDA)
## 🏷️ About This Project

This notebook is my personal walkthrough of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a structured dataset.  
I made it while trying to better understand how to look at raw data and ask the right questions before jumping into machine learning.

The goal wasn’t just to make a few graphs, but to actually “listen” to what the data is trying to say—things like:

- Which features are important?
- Are there any missing values, duplicates, or outliers?
- Do the distributions make sense?
- What relationships exist between variables?

I used basic tools—**Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and a bit of **Plotly**—to explore:

- Summary statistics (mean, median, std, skewness)
- Correlation matrix and pairplots
- Histograms, boxplots, and countplots
- Simple pattern spotting and assumptions

I kept everything modular and beginner-friendly, so I (or anyone else) can reuse this workflow for other datasets in the future.

This was more about building **intuition** than building models, and honestly, it was fun to slow down and “talk to the data” before rushing into algorithms.
